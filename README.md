# Machine Learning: Linear Regression

This repo is based on an example in the course [**Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) from the learning platfrom [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/)

The code is developed with **Matlab**

The file [`demo.mlx`](./demo.mlx) explains how the helper functions to run a linear regression model can be used.
